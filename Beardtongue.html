   <body><p>This plant is scientifically called Penstemon and is one of the best perennial plants to grow in the garden. Depending on the variety beard tongues can grow up to a meter tall and usually sport small sword-like leaves growing on the same stalks as the flowers. The tubular flowers in raceme form are outstanding in every natural color possible</p>
