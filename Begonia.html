<body><p>Begonias are unique plants popular for their colored foliage and the ability to bloom indoors. Begonias grow from underground tubers from which waxy sprout leaves that are green on the upper side and usually maroon under. In early summer, white, pink or red simple flowers emerge and continuously bloom until fall.</p></body>
