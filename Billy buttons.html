    <body><p>Billy buttons (also known as Craspedia or woollyheads) are characterized by a single golden ball of flowers borne on a thin long stem. It grows in the middle of a grass-like rosette of basal leaves. Low-maintenance, full sunlight and dry but cool acidic soil are the only key to a profusely blooming billy button. Mulches of straw and gravel can be applied to keep the soil cool.</p></body>
